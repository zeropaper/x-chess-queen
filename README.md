## Goal

## Resources

## Steps

### Create a Checkboard

Create a function called `cellClicked` which has 3 arguments (`rowNum`, `columnNum` and `event`).

Create a function called `renderChessboard` which takes the `table` element as argument.

- The function adds 8 rows (`tr`) of 8 cells (`td`) (columns), you __must__ use DOM for that because...
- Each cell has a `click` event listener which calls the `cellClicked`


__Hint:__ you can inspire your self of the matrix exercise code for that.
